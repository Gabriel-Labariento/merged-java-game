        The NetworkProtocol holds the essential information for data sending
        between client and server. It simplifies this communication by 
        creating public static final constants referenced by communication

        We have not discussed the Java language code in our program
        with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
        assigned to this course.
        We have not used Java language code obtained from another student,
        or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
        If any Java language code or documentation used in our program
        was obtained from another source, such as a textbook or website,
        that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in the comments
        of our program.
